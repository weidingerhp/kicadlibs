## KiCad Libraries

I created this repo for sharing the KiCad libs i've created. Its not hard to crate Parts in KiCad but since i am no friend of re-inventing the wheel - feel free to use.

Contributions always welcome.


Current Components:

* VoCore2 - Symbol and Print Layout
* BQLZR 1.8in LCD TFT Display With SD-Card-Reader - Symbol
* 207E-BG00-R Micro USB Connector - Print Layout
