## VoCore2 Symbol and Pin-Layout

Implementation of the VoCore2 - Item for soldering it to another PCB (Or build you own "Shields")

Known problems:
- The Symbol contains the "PCI" - Pins. Unfortunately those cannot be used that easy for the pin-layout.
- Will get errors when moving from Schematics to Board because the Pin-Layout misses the PCI-Pins.
